# 👋 Hi, I’m @evanezewski-kubra

## Conditions I like to work in
- 🎧 I'll usually be listening to music on my head phones. (They're open backed so I can hear you. Feel free to interrupt.)
- 🖥️ Multiple monitors with 4k+ resolutions are my jam
- 🔍 I tend to focus on tasks instead of spreading myself too thin
- 🔭 I tend to try to create awareness of what is on the horizon

## Times / hours I like to work
- 🕛 10AM-6PM Eastern Time
  - I live in Mississauga, Ontario and we observe DST
  - I often work outside of this time during summer hours so that I can bail early on Friday

  - Focusing on tasks
  - Lunch
  - Stretch breaks
  - Volunteer work

## 📱 Best ways to communicate with me
- ✔️ MS Teams
- ✔️ Slack
- ✔️ JIRA/Confluence
- ⭕ Email (I only check 2-3 times per day)
- ❌ Phone (Don't bother, I use a super strict Google screening approach)
- ❌ If you don't include an agenda and a goal on a meeting invite, I will probably decline it
- 💬 If I am busy, I will at least respond to you when I am free
